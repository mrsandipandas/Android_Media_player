<h3><a name="about">About this Documentation</a></h3>

This documentation is a work in progress.<p>  

Additional details and sample code will continue to be added.<p>

Recent updates include information about properties and RTSP headers, updated
documentation on the new rendering framework, more details on the <code>IListener</code> interface,
and information on the new content information structure (which now includes track information)<p>

There are still some methods of the <code>IListener</code> interface that are not fully documented.  
However,
the key methods needed for playback are documented, and combined with the example
code, this should provide enough information to implement this interface. More
detailed documentation will be added in the future.<p>


<h3><a name="mediaplay">Media Playback</a></h3>
Playback is controlled through the 
{@link com.nextreaming.nexplayerengine.NexPlayer} class, which
handles acquisition and decoding of the media data.  The application creates 
an instance of this class and issues commands to it by calling instance 
methods.  NexPlayer&trade; carries out these commands asynchronously and 
notifies the application of changes in status.<p>

The application is also notified when NexPlayer needs a surface on which to display video
or an audio track object through which to play audio.  The application must create the
relevant objects when necessary or supply references to existing instances that NexPlayer
can use.  For more information, see the 
  {@link com.nextreaming.nexplayerengine.NexPlayer.IListener#onVideoRenderCreate onVideoRenderCreate}, 
    {@link com.nextreaming.nexplayerengine.NexPlayer.IListener#onVideoRenderRender onVideoRenderRender}, 
  {@link com.nextreaming.nexplayerengine.NexPlayer.IListener#onVideoRenderDelete onVideoRenderDelete}, 
  {@link com.nextreaming.nexplayerengine.NexPlayer.IListener#onAudioRenderCreate onAudioRenderCreate}, and 
  {@link com.nextreaming.nexplayerengine.NexPlayer.IListener#onAudioRenderDelete onAudioRenderDelete}</code>
methods in {@link com.nextreaming.nexplayerengine.NexPlayer.IListener}.<p>

It is possible to set certain properties on the NexPlayer instance, which affect
how media is played back, how audio/video synchronization is handled, which player
features are enabled, and so on.  In general, the default property settings are 
suitable for most applications.  However, if you are developing a streaming media
application that uses HLS (HTTP Live Streaming), you may want to adjust the buffering time.<p>

For more information on properties, see {@link com.nextreaming.nexplayerengine.NexPlayer.NexProperty}.<p>

The application may also need to handle displaying of decoded frames, if the Java rendering method
is being used.  This is necessary to support Honeycomb.  See <a href="#honecomb">Honeycomb Support</a>
for more details.<p> 

<!--In previous versions, it was the responsibility of the application to received
decoded audio and video from the NexPlayer SDK and output the video and audio.  In the
current version this is no longer necessary, and the relevant callbacks have been removed
from the IListener interface.  Older code that implements these may have to be adjusted
in order to compile.<p>-->

<!--The application is also notified when a new video frame has been decoded and
is ready for display, or when decoded audio data is ready for output.  It is
the responsibility of the application to display the decoded video and output
the audio data.<p>-->

Notifications are handled through the 
{@link com.nextreaming.nexplayerengine.NexPlayer.IListener} interface.
The application <i>must</i> provide an object which implements this interface,
and must call {@link com.nextreaming.nexplayerengine.NexPlayer#setListener setListener}
to associate it with the <code>NexPlayer</code> instance.  <i>This must be the first thing the 
application does after instantiating NexPlayer, before calling any other 
methods.</i><p>

Once the event listener interface has been set up, the application may call
methods on the <code>NexPlayer</code> object to control the media source.
Certain calls, such as <code>open</code> and <code>close</code> must be
given in matched pairs. The basic structure of calls for media playback is as follows:<p>

<ul>
  <li>{@link com.nextreaming.nexplayerengine.NexPlayer#open(String, String, int, int, int)}</li>
  <ul>
    <li>{@link com.nextreaming.nexplayerengine.NexPlayer#start(int)}</li>
	   <ul>
      <li>{@link com.nextreaming.nexplayerengine.NexPlayer#pause()}</li>
      <li>{@link com.nextreaming.nexplayerengine.NexPlayer#seek(int)}</li>
      <li>{@link com.nextreaming.nexplayerengine.NexPlayer#seekTo(int, int)}</li>
      <li>{@link com.nextreaming.nexplayerengine.NexPlayer#resume()}</li>
    </ul>
    <li>{@link com.nextreaming.nexplayerengine.NexPlayer#stop()}</li>
  </ul>
  <li>{@link com.nextreaming.nexplayerengine.NexPlayer#close()}</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="honeycomb">Honeycomb Support</a></h3>

Under the <i>Honeycomb</i> version of the Android operating system, only the Java-based video
renderer is currently supported.  This means that in order to support Honeycomb, you must
implement Java renderer support in your application.  For other Android OS versions, this
is not necessary.<p>

See <a href="#javarenderer">Java Rendrer</a> for details.<p>

In addition, the following APIs are not supported and <b>must not be called</b> on Honeycomb:
<ul>
<li>{@link com.nextreaming.nexplayerengine.NexPlayer#setOutputPos(int, int, int, int) setOutputPos}
	For this same functionality, you pay perform scaling yourself in the <code>onVideoRenderRender</code>
	callback (see the Java Renderer explanation for details).</li>
<li>{@link com.nextreaming.nexplayerengine.NexPlayer#setDisplay(SurfaceHolder) setDisplay}</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="javarenderer">Java Renderer</a></h3>

This version of the NexPlayer&trade; engine supports Java-based rendering in addition to the usual
video rendering methods.<p>

With Java-based rendering, NexPlayer&trade; doesn't display the video after it is decoded, but
rather passes each frame to the application, which then must display the frames as they are
received.<p>

Java-based rendering tends to be slower, particularly on low-end devices, but allows the
application to perform post-processing or custom scaling operations on each frame.<p>

On the <i>Honeycomb</i> operating system, only Java-based rendering is supported.  Therefore, in
order to support Honeycomb, your application must implement Java-based rendering.  NexPlayer&trade;
will automatically switch to Java-based rendering on Honeycomb, and will use the more efficient
NexPlayer&trade; Native or Android renderers on other OS versions.<p>

If for some reason, you wish to force the use of the Java renderer, you can do so by passing
{@link com.nextreaming.nexplayerengine.NexPlayer#NEX_DEVICE_USE_JAVA NexPlayer.NEX_DEVICE_USE_JAVA}
to NexPlayer's {@link com.nextreaming.nexplayerengine.NexPlayer#init(Context,String,int) init}
method.<p>

To support the Java renderer, the application must do the following:<p>

<ul>
<li><p>In {@link com.nextreaming.nexplayerengine.NexPlayer.IListener#onVideoRenderCreate onVideoRenderCreate}, the 
	application must create a bitmap
	that NexPlayer&trade; can render frames into.</p>
	<p>NexPlayer&trade; can render in either RGBA8888 or RGB565.  The color depth is specified in the call to
	 NexPlayer's {@link com.nextreaming.nexplayerengine.NexPlayer#init init}
	method. The bitmap you create here must match that color depth.  Once the bitmap has been
	created, it must be registered with the player engine by calling {@link com.nextreaming.nexplayerengine.NexPlayer#SetBitmap SetBitmap}</p>
	<p>Here's the recommended way to support the Java renderer in <code>onVideoRenderCreate</code>:</p>
	<pre>
	{@code
	private ByteBuffer mRGBBuffer = null;
	private Bitmap mFrameBitmap = null;
	
	public void onVideoRenderCreate(
		NexPlayer mp, int width, int height,
		Object rgbBuffer) 
	{
	
		// ...other necessary onVideoRenderCreate code goes here...
		
		if(mNexPlayer.GetRenderMode() == NexPlayer.NEX_USE_RENDER_JAVA)
		{
			if(this.mScreenPixelFormat == PixelFormat.RGBA_8888)
			{
				mFrameBitmap = Bitmap.createBitmap(width, height, Config.ARGB_8888 );
			}
			else
			{
				mFrameBitmap = Bitmap.createBitmap(width, height, Config.RGB_565 );
			}
			mNexPlayer.SetBitmap( mFrameBitmap );
		}
	}
	}
	</pre>
	</li>
<li>The application must implement {@link com.nextreaming.nexplayerengine.NexPlayer.IListener#onVideoRenderRender onVideoRenderRender}.
	The bitmap registered in onVideoRenderCreate will have been filled in with the rendered frame before this method
	was called.  The application must draw that bitmap to the screen, taking into account scaling and other factors.  This can be done using standard
	Android API calls and standard Java methods.  Scaling should be taken into account.  See the sample application that
	accompanies the SDK for an example implementation of this method.</li>
</ul>

<b>Determining the Renderer:</b>  To determine the current renderer in use, call 
{@link com.nextreaming.nexplayerengine.NexPlayer#GetRenderMode() GetRenderMode}. For example, to determine
if the Java renderer is in use:
<pre>
  if(mNexPlayer.GetRenderMode() == NexPlayer.NEX_USE_RENDER_JAVA) {
    // code for Java renderer only 
  }
</pre>


<h3><a name="crashlog">Recording Recent Log Output When an Exception Occurs</a></h3>
In the event of a crash or exception, NexPlayer can save the most recent <b><font size="3">adb logcat</font></b> entries to a file on the SD card. 
Currently, a maximum of 60kb worth of log entries can be saved per crash, although that number may be changed in future versions.<p>
 
This behavior is disabled by default.  In order to enable the saving of log entries when your application stops due to a crash or exception,<br>
you have to make the following changes to your application:<p>

<OL>

<li>Import the (provided) "NexLogger.jar" file into your android project,</li><p>

<li>Your application will use the <i>android.permission.READ_LOGS permission</i>.  To indicate this, add the following line to your application's manifest:<br>
    <xmp>    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_LOGS"></uses-permission></xmp></li><p>

<li> You must declare the logging service in the application manifest, by adding the following code to the manifest:  <br>
            <xmp> 
            <service android:name="com.nextreaming.nexlogger.NexLogService" android:enabled="true"
                android:process=":remote">
                <intent-filter>
                    <action android:name="com.nextreaming.nexlogger.NexLogService" />
                </intent-filter>
            </service>
            </xmp></li><p>
<li> In your activity subclass (the one that implements NexPlayer.IListener and SurfaceHolder.Callback) you must make the following changes:<p>

     i)  In the beginning of the <b><font size="3">onCreate</font></b> method, add:<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NexLogRecorder.getInstance().startLogging(this);<p>

     ii)  In the beginning of the <b><font size="3">onStop</font></b> method, add:<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NexLogRecorder.getInstance().stopLogging();<p>  

     You will also need to import the following classes:<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException<br>      
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;com.nextreaming.nexlogger.NexLogRecorder</li>
</OL><p>
After completing these changes, recent <b><font size="3">adb logcat</font></b> output will be saved whenever a crash occurs.  Logs will be saved on the SD card, in the following location:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/sdcard/Android/data/NexPlayer/<p><p>



<h3><a name="codeclibs">Selective Codec Support</a></h3>

If your application is too large, you can reduce the size by removing NexPlayer&trade; components
that you are not using.<p>

NexPlayer&trade; comprises a total of 31 libraries (excluding DRM sample libraries). 
Of these, four libraries are always required (these comprise the engine and the rendering layer).  The
remaining libraries provide support for various codecs.<p>

NexPlayer&trade; dynamically loads codec support only for those libraries that it finds during 
initialization, so you can safely delete any library that you don't need, and NexPlayer&trade; will simply
load without support for the codecs provided by that library.<p>

The libraries are located in the <code>libs</code> folder in your project.<p>

The following table summarizes the codecs supported by each library, and the libraries required
to support each protocol type.
